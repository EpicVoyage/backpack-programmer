1. Introduction

The script compile.sh is designed to download and install all
required packages into modules.

The major caveats right now are the requirement that you
compile unionfs and squashfs modules for your running kernel,
and the number of packages which are downloaded. We don't
see a fix for the package downloads any time soon.

For a list of available options, please try:

./compile.sh --help

--------------------------------------------------
2. QuickStart

The first step is to open compile.sh in a text editor and
uncomment a mirror for Slackware and Dropline. From there,
the most basic usage is to simply run it:

./compile.sh

It is recommended that you run the command this way the first
time that the script is run. It is also recommended to use
this for the release builds, but in between there is a special
mode designed to speed up testing:

./compile.sh --fast development

This command enables fast mode, and the optional name after
it is the name of one module to delete and re-create. If you
don't wish to have the script delete a module, simply specify
"--fast" and the script will not delete any existing modules.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Saving Bandwidth

If you do not have CDs or .iso images of either Slackware or
Dropline Gnome, please disregard this section. If you do,
you can save some download time as well as bandwidth by
copying the packages (*.tgz) into the appropriate directory.

On the Slackware CD, the packages are stored under the
"slackware" directory, and then under another directory
which categorizes the packages. We lump them all into the
slackware/ directory of the build tree.

The same goes for the destination of packages found on the
Dropline CD. All packages are lumped under the dropline/
directory.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Statistics

Some stats from a full build on my (~2.2 Ghz) system:
  Packages to download: ~1.8 GB
  Disk space used:	7.8 GB
  Build time*: 		2.5 - 3 hours

* The build time does not including downloads.

5. Credits

* These scripts are copyright 2006 Daga <daga@daga.dyndns.org>,
and are released under the GPL v2.

* Much of the original scripting was the work of Thomas M. of
linux-live.org, though most things have been highly modified
(or replaced).

* This is not officially endorsed by the Dropline team, though
they do create one of the best distributions of Gnome for
Slackware.

To the last two, I would like to say "Thanks!"
