Todo:

* Possibly parse df output on startup
* Add configuration options
* A right-click (context) menu
* Color-code some important items (ie: required packages)
* Dependency checking for packages (what's missing, what's unused)
* Some configurable options like sort direction
* A whole lot more :)


Bugs:

* Probably
