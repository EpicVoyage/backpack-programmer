    <title>SCO's Deadline to Answer IBM's Motion to Compel Is Tomorrow</title>
    <description>IBM and SCO  stipulated [PDF] to allow SCO a bit more time to answer IBM's   Motion to Compel Production of Documents on SCO's Privilege Log [PDF] and the Memorandum in Support [PDF], which we discussed briefly  here.  The deadline is tomorrow.   SCO is  claiming privilege on documents created "by and for third parties" AT&amp;amp;T, USL, Novell, and Santa Cruz Operation, and IBM wants those documents.    The judge has signed the Order giving SCO the extra time, according to Pacer, but it hasn't been scanned in yet.</description>

    <title>Overview: Initial Results of a Large-Scale Migration  Project ~ by Carlo Daffara</title>
    <description>Carlo Daffara sent me a fascinating email about the European COSPA project, that is doing a controlled study of migrations to Free and Open Source software by European governmental administrations.  They are measuring and facilitating migrations in a two-step strategy,  initially to OpenOffice.org and later to GNU/Linux on the desktops.  They already have thousands of desktops migrated, with thousands more planned.  The data on switching to OpenOffice.org is very encouraging. What have they found so far?  What makes the transition work well?  Are there steps one can take to improve user acceptance and ease transitional issues?  He told me some of what they found, and I asked him if he'd be willing to elaborate on the findings for Groklaw, and he graciously agreed. Official results of the study will be available later.  This is a sneak peek, from his point of view, of what they have learned so far, plus some personal observations and tips to reduce migration shock.    If you are considering a large-scale migration to either OpenOffice.org or all the way to a GNU/Linux desktop, I think you'll find the data illuminating and his realistic and practical suggestions valuable in making it a smoother experience.  They found that a number of simple steps  encourage user acceptance.  For example, just changing the  default application for .doc, .xls, and  .ppt to OpenOffice.org resulted in significantly faster user acceptance of OOo.org, even when Microsoft Office was simultaneously available.  Interestingly, the study was in OOo 1.1.x,   not in the just-released and improved 2.0, yet acceptance and voluntary switching to OpenOffice.org was a marked finding.He explains how to solve font issues,  how to make use of hardware too old for XP  by making the switch to GNU/Linux,  offers links to tools and notes four significant technologies he's found useful in easing the stress of a large-scale migration. They also have developed some  training materials for OOo in flash and sxi format that is available under a Creative Commons license.Since 1999, Carlo Daffara has been the Italian representative to the European Working Group on Libre Software, the first IST-supported working group to deal with Open Source and Free/Libre Software.  The  group  was created at the initiative of the Information Society Directorate General  to analyze  FOSS, create a set of recommendations, and write a paper to be presented to the Commission. He  coedited with Jesus Gonzale Barahona the resulting white paper [PDF], presented at IST99 in Helsinki. Since 2000, he has been a member of the Internet Society (ISOC) working group on public software as part of the group committee, and contributed to the Open Source part of the article presented by ISOC to UNESCO on global trends for universal access to information resources. Currently Mr. Daffara is head of research of Conecta, an Open Source consulting company.</description>

    <title>OpenOffice.org 2.0 Released</title>
    <description>OpenOffice.org 2.0 is available now.  If you tried OOo in the past and felt it wasn't ready, I encourage you to try this release.  Here's the announcement from OpenOffice.org: OpenOffice.org 2.0 Is HereOpenOffice.org 2.0 is the productivity suite that individuals, governments, and corporations around the world have been expecting for the last two years. Easy to use and fluidly interoperable with every major office suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 realises the potential of open source.With new features, advanced XML capabilities and native support for the OASIS Standard OpenDocument format, OpenOffice.org 2.0 gives users around the globe the tools to be engaged and productive members of their society.Download it now. If it is not ready today in your language, it will be shortly. OpenOffice.org 2.0 is yours.		OpenOffice.org 2.0 Download		Features	 	Press information I'll let Sun's Simon Phipps tell you why this release matters:I've spoken with a wide range of local and national government officials recently, and they have almost all told me that a formal release of OpenOffice.org is very important to them as they can't deploy beta or 'release candidate' software in their organisation. I'm therefore delighted to see that OpenOffice.org 2.0 has just been released by the OpenOffice.org community. Huge congratulations to the many, many people involved in the huge task of creating a commercial-quality open source software release. It makes OpenDocument format a viable alternative for millions of people worldwide. The downloads are going to be very popular so I suggest getting the BitTorrent versions and then leaving your BitTorrent client running to help share the load. The more of us do that, the more people will have OpenOffice.org 2.0 sooner.  The OpenOffice.org Press Information page tells us a bit more: OpenOffice.org 2.0: A Choice for A Real ChangeOpenOffice.org 2.0 is the first open source office suite to offer thorough support for the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) OASIS Standard. OpenDocument is an XML file format that was developed by OASIS, the international body for the development and ratification of e-Business standards. The OpenDocument format can be used by any office application without fear of vendor specific lock-in or onerous licensing terms and fees, with the confidence that documents can be viewed, edited and printed for generations to come.The suite now also offers a database module, Base, to complement the word processor (Writer), spreadsheet manager (Calc), presentation manager (Impress) and drawing tool (Draw) modules. These give all users the tools they need to be productive in the modern world. Free for all, OpenOffice.org offers everyone the enduring freedoms to use, study, improve and share the software. Users can download it for free from the Project's Web page at http://download.openoffice.org/2.0.0/index.html.With a new user interface, OpenOffice.org 2.0 is easy to learn and use by the most inexperienced user, and is significantly more compatible with Microsoft Office files than prior versions. Supported by dozens of professional companies, OpenOffice.org 2.0 will be available in more than 60 languages. Able to run on Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris and other platforms, OpenOffice.org is increasingly the choice of businesses and governments throughout the world, and earlier versions have been downloaded over 49 million times since the project's inception.  Some new features include a new interface "designed to assist in the transition from proprietary office suites, digital signing of documents, word count functionality improvements,  import support for Corel WordPerfect, Calc support for up to 65,536 rows of data, integration of XForms inside OpenOffice.org, enhanced PDF support, and the debut of OpenOffice.org Base, a database module capable of creating self-contained, portable and cross-platform compatibility and functionality between Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Sun Solaris users.  IBM's Bob Sutor has a few suggestions, by the way, for those who want to ask Microsoft to support ODF. Here's one of several suggestions that is easy to do: "Ask your CIO (chief information officer) when you will be able to use office applications that support the OASIS OpenDocument standard." The OpenDocument Fellowship has a petition anyone can sign, if they wish to ask Microsoft to support OpenDocument Format.  Microsoft has said that they might consider doing so, if enough customer demand becomes apparent. So if you are a customer who wants ODF support, it's a good time to become apparent.</description>

    <title>Removal of Technological Arts Requirement on Business Method Patents  - Dennis Crouch Explains</title>
    <description>You know how I always write that software is math, so allowing software patents is  like patenting 2+2=4, and then telling the world they can't use 2+2 any more?  Well, they've about done it now.   I read on Patently-O about a new ruling from the US Patent Board of Appeals that I simply couldn't believe.  Here's what I read: Patent Board Eliminates "Technological Arts" Requirement For Business Method Patents Ex parte Lundgren, Appeal No. 2003-2088 (BPAI 2005). In a landmark decision, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences has issued a precedential opinion eliminating the Patent Office procedure of rejecting patents under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 101 as outside of the &#x93;technological arts.&#x94; . . .     This decision will once again expand the role of business method patents by freeing them from being tied to a computer or other electronic device.  At the same time, this decision widens the gap between the US and many other countries who are still debating patentability of software.It is unclear at this point whether the PTO solicitor will ask the Federal Circuit to review this case. . . . Lundgren had claimed a &#x93;method of compensating a manager&#x94; that involved several steps of calculating a proper compensation based on performance criteria and then transferring payment to the manager. The examiner rejected the claims arguing that they were &#x93;outside the technical arts, namely an economic theory expressed as a mathematical algorithm without the disclosure or suggestion of a computer, automated means, apparatus of any kind, the invention as claimed is found non-statutory.&#x94; There is more on Patently-O, including more information on Dr. Carl Lundgren, the brainiac who wanted a patent on a method of paying a manager.  Sigh. Can't you do that with just a pen and paper? Next they'll say we can patent our brain waves. That is, after all, where all those marketable ideas spring from, so what is to stop us from patenting the method our brain uses to come up with ideas?  Whoever gets that patent will then own all ideas, nobody else can have any without paying him, and patent law will have reached Patent Nirvana.    Naturally, I wrote to Dennis Crouch, the lawyer who writes Patently-O, immediately, because although I read the decision he provided on his site and what he wrote, I either couldn't believe it or felt I didn't understand it. Dennis is a patent attorney at McDonnell, Boehnen, Hulbert &amp;amp; Berghoff, LLP.   Well, as it happens, I did understand it. You can now patent 2 + 2 = 4. Kidding, but it's close.  Read on for what Dennis wrote to explain the decision to us. One thing I  specifically asked him to explain is, now what? How can this be overturned?  And is there anything anyone can do?</description>

    <title>Wells' Order From the October 7  Hearing</title>
    <description>Feast your eyes on this, Judge Brooke Wells' order [PDF] from the October 7th hearing on SCO's motions to compel and compel and recompel and again recompel discovery. Joke. It felt like that, though, didn't it?  It was their "Renewed" Motion to Compel Discovery (366), Renewed Motion to Compel (503), and Expedited Motion and Supporting Memorandum for Leave to Take Additional Depositions (508) that got heard that day.  Our eyewitnesses got the story accurately once again. She issued her order that very day from the bench, so we already know SCO lost the first one totally and most of the rest, but the order is breathtaking nonetheless.  Here's a portion, the part where she slaps SCO down for misrepresenting her orders: With regard to SCO's Renewed Motion to Compel, Docket No. 503, the Court finds as follows:1. IBM did not agree to produce all documents relating to the development of Linux, as SCO contends;2. The issue of the discovery from IBM of all documents relating to the development of Linux was not raised before the Court, was not understood by the Court to be a part of SCO's prior motions, and was not contemplated in the Court's March 3, 2004, January 18, 2005, and April 19, 2005 Orders (the "Orders");3. IBM appropriately interpreted the Orders, and SCO's interpretation of the Orders takes out of context what the Court believes to be the clear meaning of the Orders; 4. The declarations of Todd M. Shaughnessy regarding discovery are sufficiently in compliance with the requirements of the Court to explain those efforts made and those documents not produced; and5. At the hearing, IBM nevertheless offered to undertake a reasonable search for and produce non-privileged and non-public Linux programmer's notes, design documents, white papers, and interim or draft versions of Linux contributions from the files of 20 of the IBM Linux developers whom SCO identifies as potential deponents and whose files it would like IBM to search.Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that IBM has complied with the Orders of the Court, and that SCO's Motion to Compel Discovery and request for sanctions therein is denied.  In accord with IBM's offer, SCO is ordered to provide IBM, on or before October 12, 2005, with a list of the 20 Linux developers.  IBM will endeavor to make its production on a rolling basis, but in any case shall complete the production by December 7, 2005.  SCO must complete the deposition of these developers before January 27, 2006.  Now, compare that with any media accounts you read before the hearing.  Compare it with Groklaw's coverage of SCO's motions. Did we get it right? Or did we get it right?  One thing I see: Judge Wells knows now who she is dealing with. No more football-metaphor calls to fair play.   And that is a tremendous relief.</description>

    <title>Correcting  Forbes' Untrue Account About MySQL</title>
    <description>I am not now and I have never been a chair thrower. No, seriously. In my entire life, I've never once thrown a piece of furniture at a wall.  For that matter, I have never in my life said that I would blankety-blank kill anyone, the way a sworn statement in the Google/Microsoft/Dr. Lee litigation says  Steve Ballmer has.I'm not saying I've never been angry. I know how to feel angry, but in my biggest quarrel ever, I can't recall even thinking about throwing furniture.  For that matter, I can't remember my biggest quarrel ever.    It takes a lot to make me mad, so it's a rare event.  So, imagine my surprise to learn from Daniel Lyons' article in Forbes that I hate MySQL for entering a partnership with SCO, and I summoned its CEO, Marten Mickos,  to appear before a "Stalinist show trial" here on Groklaw, which he felt obliged to endure, "cackling" fanatic commenters and all,  in hopes of restoring his reputation.  As it happens, Marten and I were just discussing which day to publish an  article he has written for Groklaw, so we were both surprised.  So, naturally,  I asked Marten if what Forbes published about him was accurate, particularly whether he said, as Lyons reported, that   "kowtowing to the open source 'community' is the price of doing business in the open source world".  Marten has provided a statement, correcting the Forbes misinformation.  Lyons wrote things that are not true. Why?</description>

    <title>IBM Unseals Two Declarations</title>
    <description>IBM has filed a Notice of Unsealing [PDF], which tells the court that it is unsealing an Amy Sorenson Declaration in Support of IBM's Memorandum in Opposition to SCO's "Renewed" Motion to Compel [Docket Nos. 219-220] [PDF], a motion SCO already lost,  with unscanned paper exhibits, and a Declaration of Todd M. Shaughnessy in Support of IBM's Opposition to SCO's Motion for Leave to File a Third Amended Complaint [Docket No. 345] [PDF], another motion SCO lost, with paper exhibits galore. We'll have to pick them up from the court, and I can't wait because there is an abundance of materials about Project Monterey, including the Joint Development Agreement between Santa Cruz and IBM, dated 1998.  I just can't figure out from the Declaration why the last two exhibits were submitted.    Remember when Daniel Lyons at Forbes wrote that hilariously wrong article in August of 2004 about how SCO had a bombshell piece of news, that SCO was maybe really going to get IBM at last, that SCO was shocked, shocked to learn from some internal IBM emails obtained in discovery that  SVR4 was used on Power? That they had learned that IBM lacked a proper license for AIX since 2001?   It was the first time we learned about those "information wants to be free" internal IBM emails SCO kept leaking,  until SCO's    surreal and silly  motion was denied.</description>

    <title>NASCIO Conference Info ~ by Marbux</title>
    <description>Over the next few days, Microsoft will have an opportunity to hear what agroup of customer "heavies" want. The NationalAssociation of State Chief Information Officers kicks off its annualConference tonight in San Diego. NASCIO membership includes the CIOs of all50 U.S. states.If others are interested in attending, conference detailsare on the NASCIO web site, but it is a pay-to-get-in event. The event runs today through Wednesday. One panel discussion on the agendafor Monday (1:45-3:00 p.m.) may be of particular interest to Groklawfolk:Open Source: Is it Really a Free Lunch?One of the big pluses touted by Open Source advocates is the zero costacquisition of Open Source software. But at the end of the day, willdeploying Open Source software be free over time, cost the same, less ormore than proprietary software in your enterprise? If you are consideringemploying Open Source in any part of your enterprise this is a must-seesession to understand the economic impact Open Source will have on yourTotal Cost of Ownership. Your take away will be real life experiences ofthose who have taken the journey and documented all that they havelearned.Moderator: Peter Quinn, Chief Information Officer, Commonwealth ofMassachusettsPanelists: Gary Edwards, Founding Member, Oasis OpenDocumentTerry Savage, Chief Information Officer, State of NevadaBill Welty, Chief Information Officer, Air Resources Board, State ofCalifornia.Peter Quinn is the director of Massachusetts' Information TechnologyDivision who recently caused a stir by rejecting Microsoft's XML formats andadopting OpenDocument XML as a standard for executive branch procurement ofsoftware.An interview withGary Edwards ran last week on Mad Penguin and was linked from Groklaw's Newssidebar. I personally found it revelatory on OpenDocument-related issuesdespite having subscribed to OASIS.org newsletters for more than twoyears.Although not commonly known, all 50 states and local governments nationallyplus the Feds are working on an integrated time line to develop standardsfor file formats, driven by requirements of E-SIGN, the Electronic Signatures in Globaland National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001, et seq. NASCIO is the primaryorganization being used to coordinate those efforts. You can bet thatMicrosoft will be at the NASCIO conference and that the feedback it obtainsthere may well affect Microsoft decisions about supporting OpenDocument.</description>

    <title>Microsoft Says Maybe to ODF</title>
    <description>Microsoft appears to be floating a balloon to see what the reaction will be.  Andy Updegrove has blogged that the company's position now is maybe they'll support OpenDocument Format if there is enough customer demand: It seems that "wait and see" is still Microsoft's stated policy, meaning that it is keeping a back door open to the possibility of supporting OpenDocument in the future.Where do I get that? Nick Tsilas, a Senior Attorney at Microsoft I know, corrected me on this, emailing me about ten days ago as follows:    Andy, this is not accurate. I think what we have said is that features are dictated by customer demand and, until the Massachusetts-related activity occurred, Open Document was not even on our radar screens. I later got back to Nick, and asked him whether he could confirm that this is current Microsoft policy. In an email on which he copied Microsoft General Manager of Information Worker Business Strategy (I had earlier interviewed Alan in connection with the article), Nick replied:    Yes-- I can confirm that the [above] is the company position. For us this has been, and will continue to be a matter of evaluating the flow of customer requirements, and this is a new issue. For example, while the timing may be suspect to some, our pdf development was the result of evaluating customer requirements.So there is no line drawn in the sand, nor (to put it another way) has Microsoft painted itself into a corner. If OpenDocument picks up steam, a back door for support is ajar.     I am glad to see some progress, and I will applaud if Microsoft decides to do a 180 and support OpenDocument Format after all, subject only to a revision of emotion if their support turns out not to work well on purpose.There is some misinformation in the blog entry, which is surprising since Updegrove is legal counsel for OASIS. The newly formed Open Document Fellowship was not formed by OASIS or any company, to my understanding. It's individuals, and it's growing like hot cakes, by the way,  in case Microsoft wishes to know how people feel.  Here's how they feel: they want easy interoperability, they want clean XML, they want to be able to access documents 100 years from now without having to depend on Microsoft or any company,  and they want Microsoft and FOSS to get along, and that means license terms that don't exile the GPL.</description>

    <title>The First Amendment Right to Anonymous Speech - DE Ruling as Text</title>
    <description>There's an interesting First Amendment decision [PDF] out of Delaware Supreme Court, which is being noticed by the press and by lawyers,  John Doe No. 1 v. Cahill.  At issue was  anonymous speech on the Internet.    A politician wanted to "out" four critics who, he claimed, had defamed him. One of them fought back.  The ruling explains the setting: The defendant-appellant, John Doe No.1, anonymously posted allegedly defamatory statements about the plaintiff-appellee, Cahill, on an internet blog. Cahill brought a defamation action. Seeking to serve process on Doe, Cahill sought to compel the disclosure of his identity from a third party that had the information. A Superior Court judge applied a good faith standard to test the plaintiff&#x92;s complaint and ordered the third party to disclose Doe&#x92;s identity. Doe appeals from the Superior Court&#x92;s order. Because the trial judge applied a standard insufficiently protective of Doe&#x92;s First Amendment right to speak anonymously, we reverse that judgment. As you can see, the ruling speaks of a First Amendment *right* to speak anonymously. A good faith standard requires a plaintiff to show the following, as the ruling explains:   "(1) that they had a legitimate, good faith basis upon which to bring the underlying claim; (2) that the identifying information sought was directly and materially related to their claim; and (3) that the information could not be obtained from any other source." The court chose a higher standard.  The article Slashdot linked to explains what happened:  In June, the lower court judge ruled that the Cahills had established a "good faith basis" for contending that they were victims of defamation and affirmed a previous order for Comcast to disclose the bloggers' identities.One of the bloggers, referred to in court papers only as John Doe No. 1 and his blog name, "Proud Citizen," challenged the ruling, arguing that the Cahills should have been required to establish a prima facie case of defamation before seeking disclosure of the defendants' identities.The Supreme Court agreed, reversing and remanding the case to Superior Court with an order to dismiss the Cahills' claims."Because the trial judge applied a standard insufficiently protective of Doe's First Amendment right to speak anonymously, we reverse that judgment," Chief Justice Myron Steele wrote.The media and the ruling speak of bloggers, but actually the critics left messages on a public message board.  However, the ruling applies to all Internet speech, including blogging. The judge  wrote this about why he chose a higher standard  for a plaintiff to meet before the identity of  the allegedly defaming defendant could be ordered revealed: "We are concerned that setting the standard too low will chill potential posters from exercising their First Amendment right to speak anonymously," Steele wrote. "The possibility of losing anonymity in a future lawsuit could intimidate anonymous posters into self-censoring their comments or simply not commenting at all."   He wrote that the internet is a "unique democratizing  medium unlike anything that has come before" and equated blogs and chat rooms in some instances with the founding fathers' pamphleteering.  For that reason, he held that a plaintiff alleging defamation would have to show  evidence of defamation, not mere allegations, sufficient to overcome  a defendant's  motion for summary judgment. That is a very high standard. The judge was obviously aware that lawsuits are brought sometimes not for money or redress but as a weapon to suppress speech or to intimidate.    Here is what he said about the matter:  A defamation plaintiff, particularly a public figure, obtains a very important form of relief by unmasking the identity of his anonymous critics. The revelation of identity of an anonymous speaker &#x93;may subject [that speaker] to ostracism for expressing unpopular ideas, invite retaliation from those who oppose her ideas or from those whom she criticizes, or simply give unwanted exposure to her mental processes.&#x94;  Plaintiffs can often initially plead sufficient facts to meet the good faith test applied by the Superior Court, even if the defamation claim is not very strong, or worse, if they do not intend to pursue the defamation action to a final decision. After obtaining the identity of an anonymous critic through the compulsory discovery process, a defamation plaintiff who either loses on the merits or fails to pursue a lawsuit is still free to engage in extra-judicial self-help remedies; more bluntly, the plaintiff can simply seek revenge or retribution.Indeed, there is reason to believe that many defamation plaintiffs bring suit merely to unmask the identities of anonymous critics. As one commentator has noted, &#x93;[t]he sudden surge in John Doe suits stems from the fact that many defamation actions are not really about money.&#x94;  &#x93;The goals of this new breed of libel action are largely symbolic, the primary goal being to silence John Doe and others like him.&#x94;  This &#x93;sue first, ask questions later&#x94; approach, coupled with a standard only minimally protective of the anonymity of defendants, will discourage debate on important issues of public concern as more and more anonymous posters censor their online statements in response to the likelihood of being unmasked. . . .  In a case like Ramunno where the plaintiff knows the defendant&#x92;s identity, no constitutional harm comes from allowing a silly or trivial claim to survive a motion to dismiss; the trial court can easily dispose of these cases on a motion for summary judgment. In a case like the one at bar, however, substantial harm may come from allowing a plaintiff to compel the disclosure of an anonymous defendant&#x92;s identity by simply showing that his complaint can survive a motion to dismiss or that it was filed in good faith. As we intimated in Ramunno, a summary judgment proceeding can dispense with weak or even &#x93;silly&#x94; libel cases before trial (but even then only after significant expense and anxiety to the parties). Applying a summary judgment standard to a public figure defamation plaintiff&#x92;s discovery request to obtain an anonymous defendant&#x92;s identity will more appropriately protect against the chilling effect on anonymous First Amendment internet speech that can arise when plaintiffs bring trivial defamation lawsuits primarily to harass or to unmask their critics. As you can see, this judge knows how some try to abuse the legal system.</description>
