This file has a list of bugs or misfeatures  with other systems that affect
Unionfs.  To see a somewhat comprehensive list of Unionfs bugs visit

The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.  This
means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.  If you want to use
copy-on-write with NFS, set the per-branch option `nfsro'.  If this flag
is set, then Unionfs will apply standard Unix permissions to files on this
nfs-mouted branch.

Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union is mounted is currently
unsupported.  Any such change can cause Unionfs to oops, however it could even
RESULT IN DATA LOSS.

The PPC module loading algorithm has an O(N^2) loop, so it takes a while to
load the Unionfs module, because we have lots of symbols.

Older versions of Reiser4 don't work with Unionfs, because they can't handle
seeking through directories properly.
